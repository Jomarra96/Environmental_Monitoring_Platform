# System design and decisions

## Task Management Strategy: Choose between RTOS- based or state- machine approach. Explain your reasoning based on real- time requirements and power constraints.

## Data Flow Design: How data flows from Sensor → Processing → Transmission. Include buffering, data persistence (if any), and overflow handling.

## Power Management Approach: Sleep/wake cycles, radio duty cycling, low-battery behavior (if applicable).

## Error Handling Strategy: Sensor failure, network drop, TLS handshake failure—how does the system recover?

## Memory Management: How do you ensure zero heap usage while handling variable data rates and buffering?
