# Trade- offs and engineering analysis

## Design Decisions: Why you chose your specific architecture/protocol and approach

## Trade- off Analysis: Performance vs. memory vs. power consumption trade-offs you made

## Constraint Handling: How your design addresses the ≤ 64KB RAM and power constraints

## Scalability: How your approach would scale with additional sensors or longer deployment periods

## Production Readiness: What changes would you make for a production deployment
